Demo instance
=============

If you want to try out **SAUCE** without setting up your own instance,
you can access the demo instance at https://sauce-moschlar.herokuapp.com/.

Every newly set up instance has some dummy data which includes several
users and a sample event called `Programming 101 - Demo`_.

You can `log in`_ for different user roles using the following credentials:
